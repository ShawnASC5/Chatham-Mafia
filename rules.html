            <h3>Killer</h3>
            <p>
              The Killer must eliminate all other players. <br>If they are shot by a Sheriff, they are knocked out for 45 seconds.

            <h3>Medic</h3>
            <p>The Medic can revive dead players by touching them. <br> If they are shot twice, they are knocked out for a minute.</p>

            <h3>Survivor</h3>
            <p>The Survivor must survive until the end of the game. <br> If they are shot, they are knocked out until a Medic revives them.</p>

            <h3>Sheriff</h3>
            <p>The Sheriff can shoot a Killer to knock them out for 45 seconds. <br> If they are shot twice, they are dead and another player can pick up their gun.</p>

        <div class="rulebox eighty">
   
            <p>The game is recommended to be played with 4 or more people. If there are more than 5 people, there should be two killers. <br>
                Each game is 20 minutes long. At the end, there is a 5 minute round of sudden death if there are survivors remaining. <br>
                During sudden death, the medic loses their ability to heal and the Sheriff's shots only stun the killer for 30 seconds.
